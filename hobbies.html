    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
    My name is Shawn. I grew up in Montreal and speak both French 
    and English. I am a very active person who loves to do sports
    and stay healthy. I practice judo as a brown belt and play basketball,
    volleyball, tennis and many more for leisure. I also like to relax and
    watch k-dramas and anime from time to time, as well as play mobile games.

    As for why I want to become a software engineer, I wanted a challenge.
    I find it fun to solve problems and debug code. Just like with games, 
    I often get immersed in the pursuit of a goal to the point of spending 
    hours on end staring at the screen. I believe this personality trait 
    along with my hard working nature is well suited for the tasks of this
    position.
